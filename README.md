# LinkedInScrape
In this Project I have used python's selenium library to do web crawling and scrap data form linkedin pages of different companies.
The steps followed are:
1. Use selenium to login to linkedin. The emailid and password will be entered using selenium. You need to enter OTP while using it for first time
2. Once the signin is successful load the company page from which you want to scrape data
3. Locate the tag from which you want to scrape date
4. Get the text of the tag and print the data
